# Product Guidelines

This document outlines the core principles that guide the development and identity of LibreDB Studio.

## Tone of Voice

Our communication style should reflect our position as a modern, reliable, and user-centric tool. The following hierarchy should be used when crafting any user-facing text:

1.  **Innovative & Cutting-Edge:** We are a forward-thinking platform. Our language should be energetic and inspiring, highlighting advanced features and AI capabilities.
2.  **Professional & Authoritative:** We are a serious tool for professionals. Our tone should be clear, precise, and instill confidence in our reliability and expertise.
3.  **Friendly & Approachable:** We are here to help. Our communication should be welcoming, easy to understand, and supportive, especially during onboarding and for community interactions.

## Visual Design & User Experience

Our design philosophy is **Data-First & Utilitarian**. The interface must be optimized for power users who need to access and manipulate large amounts of information efficiently.

-   **Information Density:** Prioritize a dense, information-rich interface.
-   **Function over Form:** Practicality and speed take precedence over purely aesthetic choices.
-   **Clarity and Readability:** Despite the density, typography, and layout must ensure that data is easy to read and interpret.

## Brand Messaging

Our brand messaging is centered around being **Open-Source & Community Driven**.

-   **Transparency:** We are open about our development process, roadmap, and challenges.
-   **Extensibility:** We encourage and support community contributions, from plugins to core features.
-   **Collaboration:** We foster a strong community where users can share knowledge, best practices, and solutions.

## Documentation & Learning Resources

Our documentation is focused on providing **Comprehensive Technical References**.

-   **Accuracy and Detail:** Documentation must be precise, thorough, and technically accurate.
-   **Target Audience:** The primary audience is developers and DBAs who require deep technical knowledge.
-   **Completeness:** We aim to provide exhaustive API documentation, schema explanations, and advanced configuration guides.

## New Feature Development

The guiding principle for new feature development is **Innovation & Experimentation**.

-   **Rapid Prototyping:** We encourage the quick development and release of novel features.
-   **Embrace Experimentation:** We are not afraid to introduce experimental features to push the boundaries of what a SQL IDE can do.
-   **Fail Fast:** We learn from our experiments, iterating quickly based on user feedback and technical feasibility.
